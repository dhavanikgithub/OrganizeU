This Timetable Management Application serves as a comprehensive tool for academic institutions to efficiently manage schedules and provide students with easy access to their timetables. The application features two user roles: Admin and Student.


## Objective
The objective of this application project is to streamline the process of accessing the college timetable, specifically in my college. Currently, the timetable is shared as a PDF on the college's Google site. The aim is to eliminate the need for manual notifications via WhatsApp when there are changes to the timetable. Instead, students will receive updates directly on their mobile devices, ensuring they always have the latest timetable information without relying on manual notifications or PDF uploads on the college site.

Additionally, students currently face the challenge of manually finding available free classes and labs to complete college work or learn new things during their free time. This app aims to solve this problem by providing information on available free classes and labs, allowing students to easily find and utilize them as needed.
## Outcome
The outcomes of this project include an Android application that allows interaction between students and administrators. The app will have a single admin interface to manage the timetable according to the academic year, considering both even and odd semester systems. Students will have access to real-time timetable updates and notifications, with an auto-silent feature to prevent disturbances during classes. Additionally, students can use the app to view available free classes or labs.
## Approach
In this project, I employ ViewModel and Kotlin Coroutines to manage data efficiently, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and enabling asynchronous tasks handling. Utilizing RecyclerView and TabLayout for data visualization, RecyclerView efficiently displays large datasets while TabLayout organizes different sections or categories of data. The ViewModel holds UI-related data, surviving configuration changes, and exposes LiveData or StateFlow objects for observing data changes. Kotlin Coroutines handle asynchronous operations like network requests or database interactions, ensuring non-blocking execution. This architecture enables smooth user experiences by decoupling data management from UI components and leveraging efficient visualization techniques through RecyclerView and TabLayout.
